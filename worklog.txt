1) Write up errors from yesterday and the solutions that helped fix them
2) finish debugging Lagrangian.dat file 
/home/rmueller/project/rmueller/MIDOSS/MIDOSS-MOHID-config/MediumFloater/SOG_01dec2017/test3/Lagrangian1.dat
3) Python tutorial
4) Use surface currents to practice plotting up output in python
5) Read Dept. of Ecology Report

Priorities: 
1) Figure out why Lagrangian.dat file isn't working
2) Python tutorial
3) Use surface currents to practice plotting up output in python
4) Read Dept. of Ecology Report

(1) I did two test runs yesterday
 - test2 and test3.  test3 seems to work and test2 not.  When I went to verify
 files on scratch, I couldn't find the folders.  Re-doing runs to make sure that MOHID is running with the files that I think it's running with. 

Deleted all folders/files on scratch

Re-submitted test3 -> test3_2

IT WORKED!!!!  Okay...so MOHID does NOT like comments after variables in the 
header section.  

test2_7: Putting all other header information back but leaving out the comment after 
OUTPUT_TIME

I'll be damned.  It works!

Priorities:
1)  Work with Shihan in creating lagrangian.dat files for oil types and "fine combing" 
    parameter choices
2)  VVL diagnostics: plot bathymetry.dat files (after converting to netcdf) to
  see what the MOHID adjustments are.
3)  Start JGR review that is due Monday (!!!)

Test5 (submitted jobID 20768514 - Successully terminated): Changed Dispersion method to "NewDispersion" and added comments about the dispersion methods.  Sent email to Shihan to make sure my comments were/are accurate. 

Test6 (submitted job 20789924 - Successfully terminated): Changed ACCIDENT_METHOD from 1 to "Fay" per Shihan's correction
Commented out the following, as Shihan says they aren't needed for EvaporationExposure method of evaporation
   !ASPHALTENECONTENT         : 1.27
   !WAXCONTENT                : 2.9
   !RESINCONTENT              : 6.1
   !SATURATECONTENT           : 75.0


Questions: 
1) Do we want Stoke's drift on? 
2) What value for winddriftangle?  I suggest 0.0
3) What value for WindCoef?  From Li et al. (2014): From empirical data, 
the wind drift coefficient, i.e., the magnitude of wind-driven current induced 
by wind stress is approximately 0.03 of the wind speed at 10 m height and its 
direction can be assumed as nearly parallel to the wind direction [15], [16], [17]. 
Abascal et al. [18] used a set of drifting buoys during the 2002 Prestige 
oil spill in the Bay of Biscay, Spain to calibrate and validate the 
oil transport model together with meteorological data, indicating that the 
wind drag coefficient was linearly proportional to the wind speed under strong 
tidal currents, ranging from approximately 0.02 to 0.04 with the 
mean value of 0.027

I propose using a value of 0.027.

4) What value of WINDDRIFTANGLE?  I propose 3 based on Susan's email.

MOHID insights:

[Shihan, email on 5/7/19]
For most of oil types we can choose Mackay's method right now, as long as the maximum water content is available. In theory, the Fingas's method should be more advanced, but I found there's some problems with this algorithm in the code, which I promised that I will try to fix it. At this moment, I think we can use Mackay's method

I added properties for jet fuel and gas oil in that one, also changed the dispersion method to "NewDispersion"

[Susan, email 5/8/19]
Consensus at this meeting (OceanPredict) seems to be 3% of the wind for oil.*  The angle actually seems to depend on the ocean model!  This is from Graig Sutherland in particular.

* most of this is Stokes drift, if we include this separately from the wave model, we will need to decrease that 3%

test2: Changed Lagrangian.dat to reflect the parameters within <<BeginOil>> section of /home/rmueller/project/rmueller/MIDOSS/MIDOSS-MOHID-config/MediumFloater/SOG_01dec2017/Lagrangian_AKNS_crude_shihan.dat

2)  Create lagrangian.dat files for oil types
3)  VVL diagnostics: plot bathymetry.dat files (after converting to netcdf) to 
  see what the MOHID adjustments are.  

1) Worked through more of Udemy online course.  Ashu sent link to a book he likdes: http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/.  Bookmarked to review

2) Noticing big differences in the Lagrangian.dat files that Ashu was running vs. the ones that Shihan has used.  Ashu's files are missing biodegredation coefficients.  I noticed this looking into the output file on flags used.  
The model worked because biodegredation was turned off. 

-Creating a new run directory with more explicit oil type (MediumFloater) and date tag (SOG_11dec2017).

Running MOHID with a new bathymetry.  

bathymetry: /home/rmueller/Data/SalishSeaCast/grid/AfterNEMOBathy201702_rdm.dat

MOHID changes the bathymetry upon initialization and creates a modified bathymetry that then needs to be copied and/or referenced with MOHID run(s). 

First run a 10-20 minute initialization run to just get the bathymetry correct: 
hg revert -r 59 submit_run.yaml

Ashu says it's sometimes faster to run interactively and sometimes faster detatched.  Check. 

While initializing bathymetry, use run_time of 0:10:00 until the run moves beyond initialization.  This iterative process can take 1 time or many times. Unknown.

Shihan: 
- compare Johansen et al. (2015), Delvigne and Sweeney (1988) and OSCAR model to see how the different dispersion methods measure up to industry standards.
- Per email communication: The motivation to switch to Johansen et al (2015) is because it includes more testing and validation than the 1988 parameterization.

Merge with Haibo's classifications
https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/198nZehBWuXNvcAd_dev3alJB6Mp-DsGjsEWQTDOWhT0/edit

Original questions: 
1) Where oil is transported?
2) What volume to spill?

Krista has oil volume by AIS shiptype and vessel length.  Use AIS data to create a histogram of number of AIS tracks binned by spill volume potential (by linking AIS shiptype and ship length with spill volume)

Do this histogram by oil type. 
-Create map of oil transport by oil type
-Run map and information by Shell oil contact to see if it's consistent with his understanding of oil transport.

Request: 
1) Points in SOG, TP and SB that intersect with ship tracks. Give lat/lon of current locations
2) Average length of Tankers, ATBs, Bulk Carriers and Container Ships (to get estimate of increase, by gallons, of oil moving over Salish Sea if all expansion projects go through.

4/17/19
Correct bathymetry.  
MOHID sets boundaries to zero, so is it a problem that NEMO-adjusted grid has zeros along the boundary? 


Meeting with Shihan, Ashu and Xiaomei.  
Discuss:
- Test case(s)
- Validation with Oscar

Shihan: 50 runs over the past few days.  One run crashed.  Still a problem in 
converting z to k (depth issue). Shihan is using lots of particles (1500).  
A particle may have gone to a place not covered by domain. Checking algorithms for oil concentration.  Did some modifications during biodegredation work.  
May have made a change that needs to be corrected.  The pattern would be the 
same but a differnt magnitude.  Checked unmodified code and is trying to figure out the way the original mohid fixes concentration.  Max. conc. with current version is > 100 kg/m3.  When Shihan changed to original version the outcome was 9 kg/m3. Trying to figure out the correct one. 
Hopes to update/firm up by next week. 
fmevaporate, fmdisperse, fmbiodegredated is for entire mass of oil, not single 
particle.  
Shihan will have access to Oscar next month to check what Oscar concentrations
are and to determine oil groups (for biodegredation) from Oscar database  

Oscar doesn't allow for WW3 input or VVL

Comparison runs: MOHID with VVL, MOHID without VVL, Oscar (without VVL) -- need hydrodynamic input rotate to lat/lon directions and use constant temperature and salinity, flat SSH (?). 
Oscar results are only visible in the software.  
The only exported result is oil mass balance.  
Oscar model also plots profiles of concentration within the software (doesn't export).  

Single precision or double precision version.  Single is much quicker.  How can we use single precision in MOHID on Cedar? 

Still using the original bathymetry, not the NEMO-adjusted bathymetry. 
Delvinge algorithm needs correction.  It's still using the empirical algorithm for calculating wave height and period from the winds rather than from WW3.   


Ashu: 3D dissolution is zero everywhere. Shihan uses .sro file to plot net dissolution vs. time. Shihan's results have dissolution values, albeit small. 

Xiaomei: 
- Discussed OPA aggregates with Haibo.  Need to first understand the whole 
process of sedimentation, including OPA formation and sinking.  Haibo thinks 
we should first use a simple formula to demonstrate this process and then
work toward including the complexity of OPA break-down.  She has been gathering
information 

- Plans to develop equations to calculate distribution of OPA diameter.  If we 
have oil droplet size and concentration and particle size and distribution then can determine OPA size, which can be used to calculate sinking rate. 

To do: 
- Get Shihan the NEMO-adjusted bathymetry. 
- Start a conversation with Shihan and Ashu regarding model validation


4/16/19

Graham setup (from Doug's 09-Apr-2019 MEOPAR group meeting):
project/ and nearline/ have both def-allen/ and rrg-allen/ trees which are separate; use $HOME/projects/def-allen/ and $HOME/nearline/def-allen/
Forcing tree is in $HOME/projects/def-allen/SalishSea/forcing/ or $PROJECT/SalishSea/forcing/ Please put export PROJECT=$HOME/projects/def-allen in your .bash_profile to ensure that $PROJECT is defined correctly. It is automatically updated daily by the nowcast system. It has the same directory structure as on cedar, so YAML file forcing sections shouldn't need to change.

 'particle bigger than domain' error

4/3/2019
Time stepping: 


* Ashu motified .py script for creating e3t input so that masking is from "tmask" variable in 3D mesh mask

* Ashu did a run with DT_OIL = 60s and all other DT = 3600s.  NO_INTERPOLATION = 1. Using the new bathymetry file with land values = -99.  Oil moved in the run but then crashed after ~2 days. 


* Shihan has never used DT_OIL = 1200s.  He uses DT_OIL = 60s.  

* Model setup and test cases:

OUTPUT_TIME = DT_PARTIC = 1200s
DT_OIL = 60s

Test whether DT_PARTIC = 60s changes dynamics/oil advection. 

* LAYERTHICKNESS in Geometry.dat is used to initialize geometry and to set MOHID land/water points. 

* The level thicknesses in LAYERTHICKNESS are not the same as in NEMO b/c of a line length limit in MOHID .dat setting files that has prevented Shihan from putting in the exact values.  He has modified the values to work with the line length limitation.

*After model initialization, e3t is used to define level thickness as well as water/land points

* [Because LAYERTHICKNESS is used to create the initial model geometry, and because there is a line length limit that prevents us from using the actual NEMO levels, there may be a differece between the MOHID land  mask and NEMO land mask (where the sum of level thickness in MOHID doesn't match that in NEMO).  I’m still not sure if/how this may cause problems in the code if e3t is used to define land/water points after initialization, but I think it’s important to mention here.]

* e3t output is different from other output (e.g. salinity) in that other output (e.g. salinity) has values in land masked regions set to zero whereas e3t output has land values set to a default e3t value.  (I haven’t yet plotted this up yet but from the e3t on ERDAPP I’m seeing that the surface value is 1 everywhere, on land and ocean and that the standard land value changes with depth.) As such, output e3t has non-zero values where MOHID expected land (based on initialized geometry) and in places where other NEMO output (e.g. salinity) is set to zero.  Using e3t for land/water boundary after initialization was causing a problem b/c it doesn’t delineate between land and water in the same way as, e.g., salinity.

* The fix has been to multiply the output e3t by the land mask used by salinity so that there are now zeros everywhere that salinity output has zeros.  

* Can SalishSeaCast be modified so that e3t values are output with zero where there is land in order to eliminate this extra step? 

* Shihan’s has a running version of the code with the modified e3t that does not include temperature and salinity inputs.  

* Ashu created this modified e3t.hdf5 file and tried running the newest version of the code with all forcing files (including temperature and salinity), but it failed due to a overly light (less dense) water causing sinking oil. 

Ashu's run has fatal error after first time step:
-------------------------- MOHID -------------------------
 
 Running MOHID, please wait...
 
 
FATAL; INTERNAL; Function  F_FayArea - ModuleOil_0D. ERR02.


* Shihan is currently testing the new version on his end using temperature and salinity inputs. 

* Shihan is also testing the new version with Ashu’s e3t.hdf5 file, setup and forcings

1) Ashu has compiled and run the model.  It's not moving oil.
2) Shihan has compiled and run the model.  When he runs the current version, oil does move even though the current version is likely not stable. He warns that it may crash.
3) Shihan compared DWZ using his new "Imposed VVL" method and found that the 
NEMO e3t has ocean values where MOHID has land. 
4) DWZ and e3t not comparable in pre-"Imposed VVL" versions.  
5) MOHID considers land where NEMO considers water…or visa versa?  I can see a problem arising if MOHID is calculating for what it sees as water points where NEMO has land (and no information), but I have a hard time understanding how the reverse is a problem.  

SHIHAN: Yes, there're a some points, that the 2 models define differently (water or land, especially for deep levels). For example, cell A is water in NEMO, has a e3t with 26m. MOHID defined A as land point (computed from bathymetry.dat and geometry.dat); then the output DWZ of A is the FillValue -9.9*10^(-15); When I did the comparison, I made all fillvalues as 0. As a result, e3t-DWZ=26m, and you will see places with non-zero value in my comparison. Reversely, if the NEMO defined it as land, while MOHID defined as water, I turned the water points to land points, and there won't be a problem. 

6) You have noticed that e3t has a different value-extent (distinguishing land and water) than the NEMO grid…did I get that right?  (If so then it may be a problem on our end that needs to be sorted out, and I will do some plots to investigate further. )

SHIHAN: Considering the 3 question, the DWZ from MOHID, if the point is not zero or fillvalue, it should have the same value with e3t; The non-zero value in my comparison figures is caused by 0 value for DWZ, and non-zero value for e3t.

My (emailed) questions for Shihan:
Here is what I find puzzling (which you don’t have to respond to today; we can discuss tomorrow): 

(1) MOHID shouldn’t care about NEMO points where MOHID sees land so why is it a problem for NEMO to have ocean points where MOHID has land points?  
(2) Land points based on NEMO bathymetry file ought to be the same as land points in e3t.  I am curious about why these are different. 

Can you please verify (this too can wait until tomorrow) which NEMO grid your bathymetry.dat and geometry.dat files are based on?

* worked with Doug to understand why hdf5-to-netcdf4 isn't working.  We changed one word on line 252 of the code and it works fine
datetime -> naive

252    time_step = getattr(hdf5_file.root.Time, f"Time_{index:05d}")
253    time_coord = xarray.DataArray(
254        name="time",
255        data=[arrow.get(*time_step.read().astype(int)).naive],

252 Takes the Time_00000 (05d numeric value) attribute and stores into time_step 
such that,e.g., time_step = array(["2017","12","01","00","30"])

255 time_step.read().astype(int): converts from string array to integer array or array([2017, 12, ...])
    "naive" says that it doesn't need to know the date format, which is okay because we are all UTC
    * converts from array to function input format such that ([2017,12,...]) -> (2017,12,...)
    arrow is a library that for manipulating and formating date and time information.

In Lagrangian.dat, changed 
OUTPUT_TIME   : 0 3600
to 
OUTPUT_TIME   : 0 1200
to match
DT_PARTIC     : 1200

WINDDRIFTANGLE  : 0.

NOTE: $PROJECT/rmueller/MIDOSS/results = /project/6001313/rmueller/MIDOSS/results

Made list of Code development:
1) [need] VVL
	Shihan, Rachael with Susan
2) [nice] Upgrading MOHID -> read in (and output?) staggered velocities.
3) [eventually] Can we use FVCOM & NEMO?  Shihan knows how to do this : please teach Ashu and Rachael Jan 16, 2019 or later
4) [coming] Xiaomei’s plans for dilbit
	Xiaomei with Rachael: what will you need? 
5) [eventually]Vertical diffusivities in MOHID: for Lagrangian
- Shihan/Rachael: are the diffusivities used as discussed in the docs? What is standard dev?
Ben, Rachael, Susan, Elise: get the needed variables out of NEMO
6) [nice] wind drift angle and wind drag coefficient
7) [eventually] Stokes drift from WW3 already in the files 
8) [all heads] dispersion by particle, what’s really going on, also look at vertical diffusion
9) [need] Hindcast of WW3 Susan
10) [eventually] Hindcast of FVCOM
11) [coming] Sedimentation
12) [need] Code evaluation  MODID (dispersion against OSCAR) ideal case
13) [need] Run and test the model: disappearing oil
14) [need] Real bathymetry file (as in the bathymetry that corresponds to e3t)



Shihan: FVCOM & NEMO, VVL, Vertical diffusivities in MOHID for Lagrangian, dispersion by particles (8), stokes drift from WW3, read in staggered velocities

Ashu: FVCOM & NEMO, Real bathymetry file, disappearing oil (run and test model)

Xiaomei: Plans for dilbit, sedimentation

Rachael: FVCOM & NEMO, Xiaomei's plans for dilbit, VVL, dispersion by particles, Vertical diffusivities (how are they in MOHID?), Run and test model (disppearing oil). 
 

3/12/19
How does MOHID treat oil particles? Is part of a particle dispersed or is a fraction of the oil dispersed as a number of particles into the water col.? Look in "ModuleLagrangianOil.F90, subroutine OilInternalProcesses

Next: 
- diff Shihan's .dat files with Ashu's to make sure they are the same
- plot up number of particles in the surface, number of particles at depth, and total number of particles over time
- VVL: Do we need SZZ? Or DWZ, DUZ, etc. :
 
3/11/19
Ashu: Make 3 panel movie of surface concentration, integrated concentration over all but surface layer, and integrated concentrations by depth. Make 3-panel movie of oil thickness, surface concentration and zoomed in window of both, all with surface current vectors and 1 wind vector in upper right hand corner

Shihan's talk take-aways from Susan:
- Investigate wind drift and drag
- Random walk for dispersion
- Update code to get stoke's drift from WW3

Follow-up with Shihan
- How to choose number of particles?

!****************
Working with Ashu:  He is re-running MOHID after having re-installed MOHID-Cmd to see if the HDF5toNetCDF conversion now works

We are writing Shihan to ask why his output looks different.  After doing "diffs" on files, we confirmed that the only changes are file names.  All values in Lagrangian.dat are the same.  It doesn't make sense that Shihan's oil releases in a line and Ashu's at a point.

2/27/19

Work with Ashu on running MOHID on Cedar.  He rebuilt yesterday and the code now runs. Current challenge:  HDF5 to NETCDF conversion isn't working and errors differ on Cedar, Hake, and Salish.  Short-term work around: Access HDF5 output directly.  Look at oil_concentration_3D and beaching time. Work with Shihan's HDF5 reading scripts. 

Look up HDF5viewer and Panoply for looking at HDF5 files.
