* ##[HDRPS_winds.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/bitbucket.org/midoss/analysis-rachael/raw/default/notebooks/HDRPS_winds.ipynb)  
    
    **This notebook analyzes the HDRPS winds (currently for the month of January)**  

* ##[3Doilconc2CSV.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/bitbucket.org/midoss/analysis-rachael/raw/default/notebooks/3Doilconc2CSV.ipynb)  
    
    **Print (subset of) 3D Oil concentration to CSV file **  
    This script is a very basic option for printing 3D oil concentrations to CSV file.  
    "Basic" in that the header information is simply "t,d,y,x" for "time, depth, y, x" and the values are all integer values.   
      
    All of the 40 depth levels and 169 time intervals are included in output.  The x- and y-coordinates are trimmed to save space and concentrate on the regions of non-trivial values.   

* ##[make_hdf_winds.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/bitbucket.org/midoss/analysis-rachael/raw/default/notebooks/make_hdf_winds.ipynb)  
    
    **Create w-velocity HDF5 input file for MOHID from SalishSeaCast Green: "Green, Salish Sea, 3d w Grid Variable Fields, Hourly, v17-02". https://salishsea.eos.ubc.ca/erddap/griddap/ubcSSg3DwGridFields1hV17-02, for Shihan's test case 4/07/2014, 23:30:00 - 4/14/2014, 23:30:00**
